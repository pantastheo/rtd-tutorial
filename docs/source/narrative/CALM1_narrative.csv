"CALM1-related LQTS is caused by an altered gene product sequence. Reduction in the calcium dependent inactivation of the calcium channel CaV1.2 results in increased inward calcium channel current (ICaL) and repolarization delay. The disease mechanism is likely a dominant negative effect. The three CALM genes encode an identical 149aa protein, calmodulin. The CALM1 gene is located on chromosome 14, CALM2 on chromosome 2 and CALM3 on chromosome 19. Calmodulin protein is involved in many calcium-dependent intracellular processes.  All three CALM genes have been classified as Definitive for LQTS and Moderate for CPVT, certain variants are only associated with one or other phenotype, whereas others are associated with a mixed or variable phenotypes.  All variants with evidence of pathogenicity identified in the CALM genes are missense: at least 35 distinct missense variants have been identified and reported in the International Calmodulinopathy Registry including 11 (31%) in CALM1, 16 (46%) in CALM2, and 8 (23%) in CALM3. The majority of variants across the CALM genes affect amino acid residues in the EF-hand Ca2+ binding loop III and IV. Some variants have additional evidence in that the same substitution has been seen in paralogous CALM genes, or that the same substitution has been seen in a related phenotype (LQTS). Most variants are unique, but 9 were present in more than one index case and among these, three (p.Asn98Ser, p.Asp130Gly, and p.Phe142Leu, identified in 10, 5, and 4 families, respectively.) appear to be recurrent. While variants p.Asp130Gly and p.Phe142Leu have always been reported as associated with the LQTS phenotype, the variant p.Asn98Ser has phenotypic variability, including LQTS, CPVT, idiopathic VF and sudden death. The majority of CALM variants are de novo. Pathogenic variants in the CALM genes have been associated with: presentation in infancy or early childhood (up to 5 years); marked sinus bradycardia or atrioventricular block and QT prolongation; and, predominantly with CALM1 variants, a mild-to-severe neurological impairment, including seizures, development delay, motor and/or cognitive disability. The phenotype most frequently shown by patients with CALM variants is LQTS, but some patients display other phenotypes including CPVT, idiopathic VF and sudden unexplained death. Some variants have been associated with both LQTS and CPVT, however Crotti et al (PMID: 31170290) report that 'despite the relatively small numbers of cases, a significant association (p=0.001) was observed between location of mutation and phenotype (Supplementary material online, Figure S1). Indeed, a pathogenic variant in EF-hand IV Ca2+ binding loop was found in the majority (17/32, 53%) of CALM-LQTS index cases but in only one of the nine CALM-CPVTs (11%). Conversely, variants identified in CALM-CPVT index cases were mostly located either in EF-hand III (n=5, 56%), or in the inter-EF hand I-II linker (n=3, 33%).'"
