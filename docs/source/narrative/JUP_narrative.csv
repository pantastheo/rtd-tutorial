Narrative
"JUP-related Naxos disease (ARVC, woolly hair and palmoplantar keratoderma) is due to altered gene product sequence causing loss of function of JUP (PMID: 25705887; 21673311; 11691526; 10902626). JUP encodes the protein plakoglobin. Kaplan et al found that in 4 Naxos patients, Connexin43 expression at intercellular junctions was significantly reduced and mutant plakoglobin was expressed but failed to localize normally at intercellular junctions (PMID:15851108). Inheritance is autosomal recessive.  The initial nine patients described ranged in age from 7 to 41 years. Since then, more patients have been discovered carrying the disease with an estimate of 1:1000 in the population of the Greek islands. The disease has also been diagnosed in other countries (PMID: 32966140). A homozygous 2bp deletion in plakoglobin (JUP), c.2157delTG, causing a frameshift and premature termination of the protein and expression of a truncated plakoglobin lacking 56 residues from the C terminus was described in 2000 (PMID:10902626). The truncated protein was identified on western blot.  In 2017, a homozygous missense variant was described in 7 unrelated French-Canadian individuals. All had typical hair and skin findings; 4/7 had ARVC presenting after 28 years (PMID: 28098346). The effect of this variant in the heterozygous state was not investigated. Two siblings of consanguineous parents were found to have a homozygous 3bp deletion in JUP c.901903delGAG (p.Glu301del). Both had woolly hair and skin findings, only the older sister had ARVC and neither had palmoplantar keratoderma (PMID: 28098346). In OMIM there have been reports of other types of homozygous variants (nonsense, splice, missense) in JUP causing overlapping phenotypes and segregating with disease. Data on biallelic LoF variants are sparse.  In mice, generation of a null mutation of the plakoglobin gene by homologous recombination results in embryonic lethality (PMID: 8954745; 8858175). There are 2 reports in humans who had skin features but no obvious cardiomyopathy (PMID: 20130592; 21320868). In one, JUP expression in the skin was absent. Cardiac JUP expression was not directly measured to establish the consequence in the heart therefore it is not known whether variant allele was expressed, degraded, or rescued by alternate splicing. To note dominant pathogenic variants in JUP have also been rarely described in association with ARVC. Asimaki et al reported a dominant variant in JUP in a German family with ARVC and no obvious cutaneous abnormalities (PMID: 17924338). Other studies have identified heterozygous missense variants however their pathogenicity is still debated (PMID 25820315; 20031617; 31402444)."
