Narrative
"Biallelic pathogenic variants in KCNQ1 cause JLNS due to absent gene product level or altered gene product sequence. Both homozygous and compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in KCNQ1 have been reported in JLNS. Nonsense, frameshift, splice site, whole exon deletions and missense variants have been reported as pathogenic. Bhuiyan and Wilde (PMID: 23591039) compared two groups of patients with homozygous variants in KCNQ1. Those patients where there was residual IKs (slowly activating delayed rectifier potassium channel/current) even as little as 10%, had QT prolongation but no hearing loss (autosomal recessive LQTS), whereas those patients with complete absence of IKs had both QT prolongation and hearing loss (JLNS).  They concluded that homozygous or compound heterozygous nonsense, frameshift or exon skipping variants resulting in 100% loss of IKs would result in JLNS. In addition, biallelic missense mutations that lead to a protein product that does not traffic to the cell membrane (or is subject to nonsense mediated decay) will lead to JLNS. Note: heterozygous variants in KCNQ1 lead to dominant LQTS."
