"Narrative"
"Pathogenic variants in TNNT2 cause DCM due to altered gene product sequence. Only missense variants have confidently been reported as pathogenic in TNNT2 DCM cases. There are no reports of truncating variants and TNNT2 has a ClinGen Dosage haploinsufficiency score of 0, and a PLi of 0 in gnomAD (19.6 expected and 20 observed). TNNT2-related DCM is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, and disease is often an aggressive arrhythmogenic phenotype with high rates of heart failure and sudden cardiac death. TNNT2 missense mutations account for 3% of genetic DCM (PMID:27532257). TNNT2 variants are associated with an early-onset and more severe form of DCM. Of note pathogenic variants in TNNT2 are also associated hypertrophic and restrictive cardiomyopathies."
