Narrative
"SCN5A-related Brugada syndrome is caused by decreased gene product level or altered gene product sequence due to a variety of mechanisms (e.g. decreased expression of cardiac sodium channel, Nav1.5 in the sarcolemma, expression of non-functional channels, or altered gating properties leading to a decreased INa sodium current (e.g., delayed activation or earlier or faster inactivation)) (PMID: 29798782). The disease mechanism is loss of function.   To date, SCN5A is the only gene classified as having definitive evidence as a cause of monogenic Brugada syndrome (BrS) by ClinGen (PMID: 29959160). SCN5A pathogenic variants are identified in approx. 20- 30% of cases of European ancestry (PMID: 30139433; PMID 33164571). This contribution may differ in other populations.  SCN5A-related Brugada syndrome is characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance (PMID 9521325; 11748104; 25905440; 20031634; 33164571; NBK1517). Hundreds of variants, both truncating and non-truncating, have been described in association with Brugada syndrome. Kapplinger et al 2010 (PMID: 20129283) identified 293 distinct variants in SCN5A: 193 missense, 32 nonsense, 38 frameshift, 21 splice-site, and 9 inframe deletions/insertions. Walsh et al 2020 (PMID: 32893267) found that non truncating variants were highly enriched in European cases in the SCN5A transmembrane regions. More recently, a rare non-coding variant in an SCN5A intronic enhancer region has been identified in 9 patients with Brugada syndrome in Thailand (3.9% of the patient cohort). The variant is highly enriched compared to population matched controls and has been functionally validated. It causes significantly reduced SCN5A expression and a reduction in Nav1.5-mediated sodium current density. Authors describe a severe phenotype associated with this variant, 8/9 (89%) of the patients had experienced a cardiac arrest. The variant is in the RE5 enhancer region, 3-38580380-A-C (GRCh38) (PMID: 39391988). Gain of function variants are associated with Long QT syndrome. Although loss of function appears to be the accepted mechanism in Brugada syndrome the SCN5A genotype/phenotype association is still not completely understood. Uncommonly, a single variant can cause both loss of peak current and gain of late current and can lead to a mixed phenotype of LQTS and BrS (PMID: 29806494)."
