"Narrative"
"SQTS is a rare (< 1/10,000) AD inherited arrhythmia syndrome associated with atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmia, and risk of sudden cardiac arrest. Diagnosis is based on a diagnostic scorecard (PMID: 21310316), similar to LQTS. Approximately 20% of diagnosed cases will have a genetic cause, and KCNH2 is the most common identified gene.It is noteworthy that of the 18 probands with SQTS in whom KCNH2 variants have been identified, 13 had one of 2 variants; 7 with p.Thr618Ile variant (ClinVar Variation ID# 67297) and 6 with p.Asn588Lys (ClinVar Variation ID# 14436; NM_172056.2). There is high penetrance for these recurrent variants. Experimental evidence derived from non-patient cells, human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cells and a rabbit animal model (PMID: 30496390) all support the relationship of this gene with SQTS, with a gain-of-function mechanism. These experimental studies demonstrate that genetic variants identified in SQTS patients lead to potassium current perturbations concordant with SQTS phenotype and shortening of the QT interval. Note loss-of-function variants in KCNH2 are associated with Long QT Syndrome (LQTS)."
