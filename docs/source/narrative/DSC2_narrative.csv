"Narrative"
"DSC2-related ARVC is due to decreased gene product level or altered gene product sequence due to a variety of mechanisms (e.g. null alleles, trafficking defects, impaired proteolytic processing, absence of or impaired protein-protein interactions) (PMID: 31028357; 23911551; NBK1131). Loss of function is the likely disease mechanism. ClinGen found there was some evidence to support haploinsufficiency as a mechanism. https://search.clinicalgenome.org/kb/gene-dosage/HGNC:3036. Autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance is the most common mode of transmission (PMID: 21636032; 33831308). Homozygous and compound heterozygous variants have also been described in association with ARVC with or without cutaneous features (PMID: 26310507; 23863954; 24793512; 24070718; 34400560). In some cases, these appear to reflect autosomal recessive inheritance (PMID 24793512; 23863954, 33831308). Instances of digenic inheritance have been identified with DSC2 variants along with other desmosomal gene pathogenic variants (PMID: 24070718). A number of DSC2 variants have been reported in the literature including nonsense, frameshift, splice, missense and inframe insertions and deletions (NBK1131; 17033975; 17963498; 17186466; 20031616; 19863551; 31402444). DSC2-related ARVC appears to be characterised by an increased risk of biventricular involvement and heart failure when compared to PKP2-related ARVC (PMID: 34400560)."
