"Narrative"
"ACTC1 pathogenic variants cause HCM through altered gene product sequence. The disease mechanism is not definitively known but may involve impact on sarcomere force generation. There is currently little evidence to support haploinsufficiency as a mechanism. Inheritance is autosomal dominant. There is limited information regarding penetrance. The initial missense variant identified by Mogensen et al was reported to be highly penetrant in family members but with a variable age of onset and severity (PMID:10330430). ACTC1 variants account for <3-5% of HCM cases (NBK1768; PMID: 20031618).  Heterozygous missense variants are the major type of pathogenic variants found. One inframe deletion (a deletion of a single amino acid, Phe92del) has been reported in association with HCM (PMID: 20031618). This variant is classified as likely pathogenic on ClinVar. Liu et al suggest it may act to change the local structure and arrangement of amino acids in the actomyosin binding site (PMID: 28972856). Large deletions or duplications have not been described."
