"Narrative"
"Pathogenic variants in TTN cause an estimated 15-20% of familial DCM due to decreased gene product level and altered gene product sequence. The likely disease mechanism is loss of function however, it is unclear whether this is due to haploinsufficiency or a dominant negative effect, and it is likely that both mechanisms contribute. It is likely that the reduced function has a direct effect on the sarcomere, leading to impaired contractility. Truncating variants, specifically in exons constitutively expressed in cardiac tissue (percentage spliced in (PSI) >90%) see (PMID: 25589632; 27869827; 32160020), are responsible for the vast majority of TTN-related DCM cases. Missense variants are difficult to interpret, and generally not classified as disease-causing, although there are reports of at least three missense variants with evidence of pathogenicity.TTN missense variants with segregation evidence: p.Trp976Arg (PMID: 11788824) p.Ala178Asp (PMID: 27625337) p.Cys3575Ser (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.05.282913v1.full.pdf) - note not yet peer reviewed. TTN-related DCM is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and displays incomplete and age-related onset. TTN truncating variants are present in ~1% of the general population, although these variants are more likely to reside in isoforms with lower functional expression in cardiac tissue."
