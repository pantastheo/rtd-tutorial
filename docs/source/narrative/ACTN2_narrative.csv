Narrative
"Pathogenic variants in ACTN2 are definitively associated with cardiac and skeletal myopathy. They can cause disease through decreased gene product level and altered gene product sequence. ClinGen originally curated ACTN2 for intrinsic cardiomyopathy (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)) but this was re-evaluated and expanded to include other cardiomyopathy types and skeletal muscle phenotypes in December 2024 (PMID 39971408). ClinGen found no difference in the mechanisms underlying these different disease entities and therefore have grouped them together. Individuals can show variable cardiomyopathy phenotypes, arrhythmias and sudden death (PMID: 34526680); the phenotype can vary between individuals in the same family. Pathogenic variants in this gene can give rise to isolated left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The inheritance pattern is autosomal dominant; however there has been a report of a homozygous ACTN2-truncating variant (in the terminal exon) with a recessive mode of inheritance leading to restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) (PMID: 34802252). The skeletal phenotype is also variable and includes distal myopathy and congenital myopathy. As per ClinGen ‘The skeletal muscle cases reported in different families carrying ACTN2 variants had homozygous and heterozygous missense variants reported. In the combined cases, where patients presented with both cardiac and skeletal muscle phenotypes, the proband showed frameshift and missense ACTN2 variants’ (PMID: 30701273, PMID: 30900782, PMID: 38311799). Missense, nonsense, frameshift and larger deletions have all been reported in association with cardiomyopathy phenotypes. 4 missense variants have segregation data and 3 have functional data to support pathogenicity. Patients with these variants presented with atypical and diverse phenotypes. In their review, Walsh et al summarise what is known about ACTN2 variants and their role in cardiomyopathy (PMID: 34526680). Missense variants with segregation evidence: NM_001103.4(ACTN2): c.355G>A (p.Ala119Thr) PMID: 20022194, PMID:25224718; NM_001103.4(ACTN2): c.683T>C (p.Met228Thr) PMID: 25173926; NM_001103.4(ACTN2): c.959T>G (p.Leu320Arg) PMID: 30630173; NM_001103.4(ACTN2): c.1418A>G (p.Tyr473Cys) PMID: 31956495. Missense variants with functional evidence: NM_001103.4(ACTN2): c.740C>T (p.Thr247Met) PMID: 31680489; NM_001103.4(ACTN2):c.332G>T (p.Gly111Val) PMID: 17097056; NM_001103.4(ACTN2):c.355G>A (p.Ala119Thr) PMID: 20022194. According to Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), loss of function variants are constrained in ACTN2. There have been reports of deletions in ACTN2 leading to disease. An exon 3-6 deletion leading to a frameshift was found in two families with left ventricular non compaction (LVNC) and HCM (PMID 32973354) and an exon 8-10 deletion leading to an in frame deletion was found in a family with LVNC and arrhythmias (PMID: 34802252, PMID: 34526680). Truncating variants in ACTN2 have been identified in approximately 1% of patients previously classified as having LVNC. These variants were significantly enriched in individuals with an LVNC classification compared to controls (0.65% vs. 0.01%, p = 1.3E-06) (PMID 33500567). Of note, it is unclear whether these ‘LVNC’ individuals exhibited both hypertrabeculation and cardiomyopathy or only hypertrabeculation. Overall, rare variants are not enriched for ACTN2 in HCM or DCM cohorts which suggests they are rarely causative of disease so should be interpreted with caution in cardiomyopathy patients (PMID: 27532257, PMID: 31983221).
