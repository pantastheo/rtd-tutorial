Narrative
"DSG2-related ARVC is due to decreased gene product level or altered gene product sequence due to a variety of mechanisms.  Much of the underlying pathogenesis of DSG2 pathogenic variants is still unknown; it is believed that loss of DSG2 compromises cell-to-cell adhesion between cardiomyocytes (PMID:26085008; NBK1131). There is also work revealing that desmosomal variants can reduce canonical Wnt signaling and activating Wnt with a GSK3B inhibitor can block disease pathogenesis (PMID 16823493; 27170944). The usual mode of inheritance is autosomal dominant characterized by incomplete penetrance (PMID: 21636032; 33831308). Compound heterozygous and homozygous variants have been described. In some families, heterozygous carriers of these variants were not affected suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance (PMID: 33917638; 34400560; 24070718; 33831308; 30454721). Patients with >1 variant appear to have a more severe phenotype (PMID: 25616645; PMID: 30790397).  The majority of DSG2 variants are rare missense variants with unknown significance/unknown mechanism of pathogenicity. In addition, nonsense, frameshift, insertions, deletions, and splice site variants have all been described (PMID: 16505173; NBK1131; 30790397; 27532257; 33917638).  DSG2-related ARVC appears to be characterised by an increased risk of biventricular involvement and heart failure when compared to PKP2-related ARVC (PMID: 34400560; 30790397)."
