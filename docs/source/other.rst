Other potentially relevant variant classes
==========================================

Which variant classes should I filter for? The main table shows variant
classes that have been reported to cause disease. We would expect other
variant classes with similar consequences to cause disease (e.g. if
NMD_triggering frameshift cause disease, then NMD_triggering nonsense
probably do too). This table below shows the full list of variant
classes mapped to each variant consequence.
