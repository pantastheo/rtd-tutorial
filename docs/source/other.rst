Other potentially relevant variant classes
==========================================

Which variant classes should I filter for? The main table shows variant
classes that have been reported to cause disease. We would expect other
variant classes with similar consequences to cause disease (e.g. if
NMD_triggering frameshift cause disease, then NMD_triggering nonsense
probably do too). This table below shows the full list of variant
classes mapped to each variant consequence.


.. note::

  Variant classes with a likelihood score of '3:possible', '4:probable' and '5:almost always' for the different disease associated variant consequences
  
  See Tables 2 and 3 from Roberts et al.
