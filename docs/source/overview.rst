Overview
========

*CardiacG2P* is an evidence-based dataset for inherited cardiac condition gene disease pairs. Each entry annotates a disease-associated gene with information about the gene-disease relationship, including the inheritance mode and allelic requirement, information pertaining to disease mechanism (represented as a disease-associated variant consequence), and known disease-relevant variant classes at a defined locus.

This dataset is also available through `G2P <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gene2phenotype>`_

.. note::

   This project is under active development.

   Cardiac G2P hosts its documentation on Read the Docs.
