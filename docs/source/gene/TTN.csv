Gene symbol,TTN
Gene mim,188840
Indication,DCM
Referral indication,Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)
Disease grouping,Familial dilated cardiomyopathy
Disease name,TTN-related Dilated cardiomyopathy
Gene disease validity (ClinGen),definitive
Allelic requirement,monoallelic_autosomal
Inheritance,Autosomal dominant
Inheritance modifiers,Typified by incomplete penetrance; Typified by age-related onset
Disease-associated variant consequence,altered gene product sequence;decreased gene product level
mechanism,NA
mutation consequence flag,restricted repertoire of mutations
Restricted repertoire of pathogenic variants,Variants must occur in A-band or >90% percentage spliced in (PSI) exons. Pathogenic missense variants are very rare. Missense variants with segregation evidence: NM_001267550.2(TTN):c.2926T>C (p.Trp976Arg); NM_001267550.2(TTN):c.533C>A (p.Ala178Asp); NM_001267550.2(TTN):c.11674T>A (p.Cys3892Ser)
Variant classes reported with evidence of pathogenicity,splice_acceptor_variant;splice_donor_variant;frameshift_variant;stop_gained;missense_variant;stop_gained_NMD_triggering;frameshift_variant_NMD_triggering;exon_loss_variant
