Narrative
---------

DSC2-related ARVC is due to **decreased gene product level or altered gene product sequence** due to a variety of mechanisms (e.g. null alleles, trafficking defects, impaired proteolytic processing, absence of or impaired protein-protein interactions) (PMID: 31028357; 23911551; NBK1131).
Loss of function is the likely disease mechanism. ClinGen found there was some evidence to support haploinsufficiency as a mechanism. https://search.clinicalgenome.org/kb/gene-dosage/HGNC:3036.
Autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance is the most common mode of transmission (PMID: 21636032; 33831308). Homozygous and compound heterozygous variants have also been described in association with ARVC with or without cutaneous features (PMID: 26310507; 23863954; 24793512; 24070718; 34400560). In some cases, these appear to reflect autosomal recessive inheritance (PMID 24793512; 23863954, 33831308). Instances of digenic inheritance have been identified with DSC2 variants along with other desmosomal gene pathogenic variants (PMID: 24070718).
A number of DSC2 variants have been reported in the literature including nonsense, frameshift, splice, missense and inframe insertions and deletions (NBK1131; 17033975; 17963498; 17186466; 20031616; 19863551; 31402444).
DSC2-related ARVC appears to be characterised by an increased risk of biventricular involvement and heart failure when compared to PKP2-related ARVC (PMID: 34400560).

Narrative
---------

DSG2-related ARVC is due to **decreased gene product level or altered gene product sequence** due to a variety of mechanisms.  Much of the underlying pathogenesis of DSG2 pathogenic variants is still unknown; it is believed that loss of DSG2 compromises cell-to-cell adhesion between cardiomyocytes (PMID: 26085008; NBK1131). There is also work revealing that desmosomal variants can reduce canonical Wnt signaling and activating Wnt with a GSK3B inhibitor can block disease pathogenesis (PMID: 16823493; PMID: 27170944).
The usual mode of inheritance is **autosomal dominant characterized by incomplete penetrance** (PMID: 21636032; 33831308). Compound heterozygous and homozygous variants have been described. In some families, heterozygous carriers of these variants were not affected suggesting **autosomal recessive inheritance** (PMID: 33917638; 34400560; 24070718; 33831308; 30454721). Patients with >1 variant appear to have a more severe phenotype (PMID: 25616645; PMID: 30790397).

The majority of DSG2 variants are rare missense variants with unknown significance/unknown mechanism of pathogenicity. In addition, nonsense, frameshift, insertions, deletions, and splice site variants have all been described (PMID: 16505173; NBK1131; 30790397; 27532257; 33917638).
DSG2-related ARVC appears to be characterised by an increased risk of biventricular involvement and heart failure when compared to PKP2-related ARVC (PMID: 34400560; 30790397).

Narrative
---------

JUP-related Naxos disease (ARVC, woolly hair and palmoplantar keratoderma) is due to **altered gene product sequence** causing loss of function of JUP (PMID: 25705887; 21673311; 11691526; 10902626). JUP encodes the protein plakoglobin. Kaplan et al found that in 4 Naxos patients, Connexin43 expression at intercellular junctions was significantly reduced and mutant plakoglobin was expressed but failed to localize normally at intercellular junctions (PMID: 15851108).
**Inheritance is autosomal recessive**.
The initial nine patients described ranged in age from 7 to 41 years. Since then, more patients have been discovered carrying the disease with an estimate of 1:1000 in the population of the Greek islands. The disease has also been diagnosed in other countries (PMID: 32966140).
**A homozygous 2bp deletion** in plakoglobin (JUP), c.2157delTG, causing a frameshift and premature termination of the protein and expression of a truncated plakoglobin lacking 56 residues from the C terminus was described in 2000 (PMID: 10902626). The truncated protein was identified on western blot.<br/>  **In 2017, a homozygous missense variant** was described in 7 unrelated French-Canadian individuals. All had typical hair and skin findings; 4/7 had ARVC presenting after 28 years (PMID: 28098346). The effect of this variant in the heterozygous state was not investigated.<br/> Two siblings of consanguineous parents were found to have a **homozygous 3bp deletion** in JUP c.901903delGAG (p.Glu301del). Both had woolly hair and skin findings, only the older sister had ARVC and neither had palmoplantar keratoderma (PMID: 28098346).
In OMIM there have been reports of other types of homozygous variants (nonsense, splice, missense) in JUP causing overlapping phenotypes and segregating with disease. Data on biallelic LoF variants are sparse.  In mice, generation of a null mutation of the plakoglobin gene by homologous recombination results in embryonic lethality (PMID: 8954745; 8858175). There are 2 reports in humans who had skin features but no obvious cardiomyopathy (PMID: 20130592; 21320868). In one, JUP expression in the skin was absent. Cardiac JUP expression was not directly measured to establish the consequence in the heart - it is not known whether variant allele was expressed, degraded, or rescued by alternate splicing.
To note dominant pathogenic variants in JUP have also been rarely described in association with ARVC. Asimaki et al reported a dominant variant in JUP in a German family with ARVC and no obvious cutaneous abnormalities (PMID: 17924338). Other studies have identified heterozygous missense variants however their pathogenicity is still debated (PMID: 25820315; 20031617; 31402444).
